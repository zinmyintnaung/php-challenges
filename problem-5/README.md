## Problem 5

### Accept two linked list and add each node reversely, then return the new linked list (Refer Problem 2)

Given:
First LinkedList Object ( [head] =>
Node Object ([val] => 1 [next] =>
Node Object ([val] => 0 [next] =>
Node Object ( [val] => 1 [next] => ) ) ) )

Second LinkedList Object ( [head] =>
Node Object ([val] => 7 [next] =>
Node Object ([val] => 1 [next] =>
Node Object ( [val] => 1 [next] => ) ) ) )

Return:
LinkedList Object ( [head] =>
Node Object ([val] => 8 [next] =>
Node Object ([val] => 1 [next] =>
Node Object ( [val] => 2 [next] => ) ) ) )

Explanation: 101 + 117 = 218, therefore, the answer is LinkedList with 8, 1 and 2.

-   Assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
