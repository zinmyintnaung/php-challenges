## Problem 2

### You are given two non-empty array representing two non-negative integers. Each element is the single digit and stored in reverse order. Add the two numbers and return the sum as reverse order array.

Given:
First Array [1, 0, 1];
Second Array = [7, 1, 1];

Return:
Array [8, 1, 2]

Explanation: 101 + 117 = 218, therefore, the answer is Array [8, 1, 2]

-   Assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
