### Given: Array [1, 2, 3, 4, 0], Target = 6

### Return: Array [1, 3]

Explanation: Return the two indices of the given array where two elements add up to target value (2 [index position 1] + 4 [index position 3])

-   Assume that each input would have exactly one solution (e.g. no array such as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] with target = 6, because 1+5 = 2+4 =6)
